# ComputerVision_StamaticsIITK
This repository contains the content covered in Computer Vision project offered by Stamatics society at IIT Kanpur in 2021.
There are 5 solved colab assignments,
and code for the project made by me(in team of 3 students) for end-term evaluation.
The project is basically a CV model to predict the number represented by hand
by showing respective number of fingers using only computer vision techniques.
